## About The Project

This is a nostalgia fueled passion project built on React that revolves around one of my favorite and the best-selling games for the Nintendo Gamecube: Super Smash Bros. Melee. This app reflects the game itself in that it can be enjoyed on a spectrum ranging from casual to more serious fans. It hosts an unseen breadth of questions ranging from traditional categories like multiple choice, true/false trivia questions for a slightly more casual experience. For those hardcore Melee fans seeking a true challenge, I've included a special "Guess That Player" category where video clips of professional players are displayed with gamer tags and commentary omitted where the player must figure out who's playing. Many features and aesthetic improvements to come. Any and all suggestions are welcomed.
