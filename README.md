## About The Project

This is a nostalgia fueled passion project built on React that revolves around the one of my favorite and the best-selling games for the Nintendo Gamecube: Super Smash Bros. Melee. It serves up an unseen breadth of questions from categories including multiple choice, true/false trivia questions in addition to a "Guess That Player" category where video clips of professional players are displayed with gamer tags and commentary removed and you have to figure out whos' playing. Many features and aesthetic improvements to come.
